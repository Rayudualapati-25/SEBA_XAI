/**
 * The explainable-AI module.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — what the AI does and does not do:
 *   The LLM does NOT decide anything. The allow/deny/escalate decision is made
 *   by the policy rules inside the chaincode and is already written to the
 *   blockchain before this file runs. All the LLM does is rewrite that recorded
 *   decision into a readable sentence.
 *
 * Why it must stay that way: the paper's claim is that decisions are
 * deterministic and reproducible. An LLM deciding access would break that, and
 * the same request could get different answers on different days.
 *
 * Safety steps in order:
 *   1. read the decision back from the blockchain (never trust the browser)
 *   2. build a prompt from a fixed list of safe fields (no case contents)
 *   3. ask the local model
 *   4. check the answer is grounded; if not, use the template instead
